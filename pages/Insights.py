While no factor shows a strong individual correlation, these three stand out in relative importance based on the regression analysis',
                   'Sleep disorders vary across demographics. Insomnia is more common in males, while females are more affected by Sleep Apnea. The 36â€“45 age group shows the highest occurrence of both disorders, while no cases of Sleep Apnea were found in participants over 66. Office workers are most affected by both conditions, followed by students with Insomnia. Overall, Insomnia is more prevalent across all groups. This suggests that individuals engaged in work or academicsâ€”particularly males in their 30sâ€“40sâ€”may be more prone to sleep disorders due to environmental stress',

                      'No significant relationship was found between cardiovascular factors and sleep duration. Sleep duration is evenly distributed across blood pressure categories, with hypothesis testing (p = 0.233) supporting this. However, participants with low heart rates appear less prone to sleep disorders, while most with disorders have normal heart rates.',

Both disorders show similar distributions in daily steps and overall spread. However, Mann-Whitney tests indicate no significant difference between the two disorders across these factors.']
